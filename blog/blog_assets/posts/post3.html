										I was oddly moved by a simple scene at Haneda airport. There was an employee at the baggage claim catching each bag as it fell down the ramp: basically his only duty was to make sure no bag hit the guardrail with significant force. I don't know how long he was assigned to this duty, but for the ~one hour that I was there waiting for my luggage, it looked like that's all he was asked to do. When all the bags had been exhausted from one plane, he'd walk to the next carousel and give the same royal treatment to all those bags. 
								    </p>
									<p>
										At first glance, this just seems like a sensible, nice touch to Haneda airport, and maybe you don't think too much of it either. I thought a lot about that man though. I'm sure at the beginning of his shift, he huddled up with fellow coworkers as his boss assigned duties. And his boss must've very intentionally told him, "You're going to go to the carousels and make sure no bag smacks its face on the guardrail." He wasn't just an inevitable piece of the airport: he was <i>deliberately</i> placed there. He's a distinct individual, and why on earth did he accept a job with the airport where part of his job entails catching bags on the carousels all night long? It's kind of like how readers might easily forget about a certain detail or side character in a story, but every one of those details represents a deliberate choice on the author's part. So it blew my mind that something that just seemed so quotidian and forgettable was really the product of someone's conscious decision. And in fact, every person at that busy airport was a deliberate choice. Each person chose to be there at that time. The odds of every single one of us meeting there again at the same time are next to nil.
									</p>
									<p>
										We can go even deeper, really. The odds of this particular permutation of souls existing on planet Earth right now are next to nil as well. We were each conceived by one particular sperm fertilizing one particular egg. If even just one other sperm made it to the egg first, our soul would cease to exist; we'd be replaced by someone else entirely. The same odds stack for every member of your family tree: every ancestor stretching back thousands of years is the product of the one-in-a-million sperm that first reached an egg, and that ancestor had to survive long enough in times of war and famine to reproduce. What are the odds that you exist? What are the odds that your friend exists, or the 7 billion others here today? Now, ontological reductionism is clearly a fallacious argument given that you'd probably still be you give or take a few no-op mutations. But take into account the compounding effects of next-to-nil-chance fertilizations across generations, and we're looking at a crazy one-in-a-billion-billion group of folks on Earth right now.
									</p>
									<p>
										I digress. I'll probably never see an employee catching bags at an American airport. And why should I? The only reason I would is if some airport managers <i>deliberately</i> assign their reports to the carousels with the sole duty of catching bags. Those are precious payroll hours. Who on earth would dedicate limited employee hours to a task with such low returns? Efficiency is the name of the game here. I wonder if that's why Japanese society is noticeably more polite than American society. Maybe our issue is that we've excessively reduced working to ill-conceived metrics of productivity, and who has time to pamper the bags in that kind of environment? Maybe Japanese society recognizes that not everything needs a $ justification.
									</p>
									<p>
										Anyway, that's why I was so moved at the airport. Thank you, Mr. Carousel-Man.
