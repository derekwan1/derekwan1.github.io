										<h1>On Stress</h1>

										I once watched a ditsy show (might’ve been <i>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</i>?) in which some 50-year-old rich lady was wailing on a girls’ retreat because she didn’t bring her makeup. Honestly this was just reality TV and not that deep, but that scene burned into the back of my eyelids. She seemed <i>really</i> upset, as if no one had ever experienced anything worse.
									</p>
									<p>
										It made me think. If we could somehow get a quantitative measurement of her distress, I wonder how it would compare to that of a starving pauper fighting for food scraps. This is pure speculation, but I suspect they may actually be pretty similar. The Beverly Hills woman was thoroughly lost in her emotions, just like someone fighting for food would be overwhelmed by his hunger. I don't think the gravity of the situation really matters. People will find a way to hit emotional rock bottom anyway.

								    	My grandma once said (cynically) that depressed people are only depressed because they have too much time to think. I don't agree entirely, but I think she's kind of on the right track. I know of a particular mother-daughter duo: the mother was never depressed her entire life, but the daughter was clinically depressed and even attempted suicide. Interestingly, the mother actually lived through the Cultural Revolution, meaning that she witnessed horrors such as her college professor being tortured to death and her friend losing an arm as punishment for not cleaning a portrait of Mao properly. Meanwhile, the daughter grew up in a stable middle class family in post-Mao China, but she was almost driven to suicide by workplace bullying and sexual harassment at a bank. I think it's reductive to say that the younger woman was just overthinking. My theory is that the older woman reacted with the primal part of her brain in response to witnessing atrocities, and the younger woman reacted with the more developed part of her brain in response to bullying. In the face of extreme violence, what choice do you have but to focus on survival? There's no time to be traumatized because being traumatized requires emotional processing, and I don't think anyone is reflecting on their emotions when their lizard brains take over in response to extreme violence. On the other hand, workplace bullying--although upsetting--doesn't trigger those deep, animal neurons. Instead, we react with human thoughts and emotions, and somehow that leaves us even worse off in an objectively safer situation.

								    	I think it was Stalin who once said something like “Death is a tragedy, but a million deaths is a number.” That checks out. One death leaves room for emotional processing. A million deaths is so unfathomable that our animal brain has to respond with numbness.

								    	I’ve been thinking about that Beverly Hills housewife a lot recently because lately I’ve also been feeling crushed. Sometimes I feel like I want to scream into a lake until the entire surface boils. Even after going through this thought experiment about primal vs developed responses, and thinking that my struggles are probably just as ridiculous as the housewife's makeup issues, I still feel the same. 
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	I have a theory about this as well. I think there will always be a path to emotional rock bottom if you look hard enough for it. There are also paths that take you nowhere emotionally, and probably there are paths to giddy happiness too, no matter the circumstances. Some people just naturally go straight for the path that takes them -90&deg;. I think I'm predisposed to go for -70&deg; unless I consciously make an effort to shoot for +45&deg;. Retired people probably trend toward the 0&deg; paths. You know what I mean. This is just a convoluted way of saying that happiness is a function of the person, not the situation. Not really that profound or insightful. If I'm adding anything at all to the conversation, it's that happiness is a spectrum, and maybe +1&deg; is enough to strive for on tough days. I think many people just give up on looking for that +1&deg; path because they think happiness only exists at the end of the +90&deg; path, and the hill is too steep to climb.

								    	Someone once told me that if all the people in the world were to hang their sorrows from a tree, we'd still pick our own. I'm not sure why, but that makes me feel a certain kind of way, like I want to cradle the thought in my arms. I think the conjecture is true. I can only speak for myself, but I think it's maybe because we're like little gophers in the ground, and even if we're buried deep in our sorrows, we're familiar with all the tunnels that go up / down / sideways; we know our struggles intimately, and we have a rough idea of what will exacerbate or alleviate them. Even if the going gets tough, we'd rather wallow in our own pigsty because it's shit of our own making.
