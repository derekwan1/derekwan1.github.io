										<h1>On Depression</h1>
										<h2>May 24, 2025</h2>
									</header>

									<p>
										I would never harm myself intentionally, but for the first time I think I understand the appeal. It’s a bit like wanting to hurt something/someone you find super cute. The emotional weight is so intense that it overflows to the other end of the spectrum. And with sadness too, I think sometimes things just look so bleak you can’t help but want to make things even worse. It’s almost indulgent to dig a deeper hole.
									</p>
									<p>
										It’s been a while since I’ve been completely happy and relaxed—almost a year now. My parents say I seem happier in NYC, but I’m running out of steam to keep myself afloat. This is the longest continuous time I’ve been on edge, in my entire life I think.
									</p>
									<p>
										Work is technically challenging. I struggle with some coworkers. Friends are busy. My heart is a bar of soap that I lost hold of. I looked away for one second and it slipped and got broken, all in the wink of an eye. I am not in control.
									</p>
									<p>
										Sometimes it hurts, it really hurts, for no other reason than the fact that my skin doesn’t feel like it’s mine. I have trouble sleeping. I can't sleep without pills, and even with them sometimes I still lie awake. On some nights, when it’s unbearable, I get up to run before dawn, mile after mile until I grind myself to dust. Not because I’m a testosterone-driven hunter, but because the only way I know to stop hurting is to be completely and utterly exhausted. The moment I have any surplus energy I start thinking about her, and I go to pieces. How did I get to this state? I wasn’t even this upset when my 4-year relationship ended.
									</p>
									<p>
										You’ve probably been depressed yourself, had days when you’ve been in terrible pain in places that don’t show up in X-rays, when you can’t find the words to explain it even to the people who love you. Deep down, in memories that we might prefer to suppress even from ourselves, a lot of us know that the difference between us and a man on the bridge is smaller than we might wish. I’ve felt that connection with others throughout my life — sometimes it’s a random person who’s homeless or just down on his luck, and for reasons I can’t explain, there is a connection, not just eyes meeting but a feeling as if it’s my own face staring back at me. Just like them, I’m hanging on by a thread.
									</p>
									<p>
										And yet, life moves on. This speck of dust we call home hurls itself at empty space at 2 million miles an hour and stops for no one. It speeds through the darkness whether you’re happy or not. Whether you’re here or not. Earth will never occupy the exact same space ever again no matter how badly you want it to stay put, if for some reason you ever had that wish. 
									</p>
									<p>
										The sky doesn’t bother trying to impress us anymore. It’s the color of newspaper in a puddle. Like someone has been setting fire to ghosts. I open my eyes in the morning and life is just waiting to tip a fresh avalanche of “Don’t Forget!”s and “Remember!”s over me. I just wake up and start digging through the heap because there will be another one dumped on me tomorrow, and no one will care whether I’ve finished. 
									</p>
									<p>
										At times like these, I wish I was a dog. I wish I could surrender my ambition, aspirations, and abilities and just be held and taken care of for a little while.
