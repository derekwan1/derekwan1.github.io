										<h1>On Depression</h1>
										<h2>May 25, 2025</h2>
									</header>

									<p>
										For the first time I think I understand the appeal of self harm. It’s a bit like wanting to hurt something/someone you find super cute. The emotional weight is so intense that it overflows to the other end of the spectrum. And with sadness too, I think sometimes things just look so bleak you can’t help but want to make things even worse. It’s almost indulgent to dig a deeper hole.
									</p>
									<p>
										It’s been a while since I’ve been completely happy and relaxed—almost a year now. My parents say I seem happier in NYC, but I’m running out of steam to keep myself afloat. This is the longest continuous time I’ve been on edge, in my entire life I think.
									</p>
									<p>
										Work is technically challenging. I struggle with some coworkers. Friends are busy. My heart is a bar of soap that I lost hold of. I looked away for one second and it slipped and broke, all in the wink of an eye. I am not in control.
									</p>
									<p>
										Sometimes it hurts, it really hurts, for no other reason than the fact that my skin doesn’t feel like it’s mine. I have trouble sleeping. I can't sleep without pills, and even with them sometimes I still lie awake. On some nights, when it’s unbearable, I get up to run, pounding mile after mile until I grind myself to dust. Not because I’m a determined hunter, but because the only way I know to stop hurting is to be completely and utterly exhausted. The moment I have any surplus energy I start thinking about her, and I go to pieces.
									</p>
									<p>
										You’ve probably been depressed yourself, had days when you’ve been in terrible pain in places that don’t show up in X-rays, when you can’t find the words to explain it even to the people who love you. Deep down, in memories that we might prefer to suppress even from ourselves, a lot of us know that the difference between us and a man on the bridge is smaller than we might wish. I’ve felt that connection with others throughout my life — sometimes it’s a random person who’s homeless or just down on his luck, and there is a connection, not just eyes meeting but a feeling as if it’s my own face staring back at me. Just like them, I’m hanging on by a thread.
									</p>
									<p>
										And yet, life moves on. This speck of dust we call home hurls itself at empty space at 2 million miles an hour and stops for no one. It speeds through the darkness whether I'm happy or not. Whether I'm here or not.
									</p>
									<p>
										The sky doesn’t bother trying to impress us anymore. It’s the color of newspaper in a puddle. Like someone has been setting fire to souls. I open my eyes in the morning and life is just waiting to tip a fresh avalanche of “Don’t Forget!”s and “Remember!”s over me. I wake up and start digging through the heap because there will be another one dumped on me tomorrow, and no one will care whether I’ve finished today's. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I wish I could just be held and taken care of for a little while. Just until I can breathe again.
