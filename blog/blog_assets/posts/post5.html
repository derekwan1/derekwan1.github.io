										I sold my car yesterday.
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	An unceremonious end to an 18-year run, really. I grabbed my stuff, handed over the keys, and just like that, my friend and fellow adventurer was gone. No chance for a proper goodbye (if there even is one): I was too overwhelmed by the sheer logistics and paperwork.
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	I took a Lyft back home. My driver's name was Abdi, and he asked what I was doing in Auburn. "I just sold a very meaningful car, I said
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	"Yeah?" he says. "A Mercedes? Tesla?"
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	"No, a 2007 hand-me-down."
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	"Your favorite kind of car?"
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	"I'm not really into any particular kind of car, actually."
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	"Strange."
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	"Yeah, strange."
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	Now, I know exactly what I should have said to him instead. Of course, I only got this straight after hours of replaying the day's conversations in my head. That's how it always is though. Oh well. 
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	"My parents bought this car when I was a kid. At the time, this would've been considered a luxury SUV: it had a backup camera, a touch screen with bluetooth, and heated seats. My grandparents were so proud. And my dad was pretty miffed when my mom insisted on taking me to school in it; that meant he was stuck with the older car for his daily commute. And in LA, commutes are <i>long</i>.
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	My mom introduced me to the <i>Phantom of the Opera</i> soundtrack in this car. I always sat on the left side; my brother on the right. Even if he wasn't there, I'd still sit on the left. There's a trapdoor-like section between the front two seats. I always bumped my knee on that when I leaned forward for my mom to kiss me goodbye at the school dropoff.
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	Since my dad wouldn't come home until late at night, that meant I also went to afterschool activities in our fabulous car. I always felt guilty after swim practice. I'd stink so much of chlorine that we had to open the windows and run the fan on max to breathe. And I'd sit in shame in this car after piano and cello lessons because they were usually trainwrecks; I was always too exhausted from swimming to play well.
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	I stuck my head against that backseat left window for hours on the drive home from swim meets. You can never be too fast or too good, and I was too young to emotionally cope with that level of competition. I once ranked 13th in the U.S. Can you believe it, Abdi? But I remember crying on the way home because I wasn't in the top 10. I missed the cut by 0.04 seconds. Had I grown my fingernails out, maybe things would have turned out differently. Brutal.
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	I practiced driving in this car. My friend's dad was a driving coach and would take me for lessons. By lessons, I mean he'd scream in my ear in Cantonese, which I didn't understand at all. I was a horrible driver, but I still passed because there was so much construction around the DMV that traffic moved at a snail's pace. He was shocked. I was too, but I pretended not to be.
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	When Maxie passed away, we took his body to the animal shelter in the trunk of this car. I had to catch a flight that same morning though. I rubbed my tears out on that left backseat window. My eyes kept leaking the whole flight and for hours afterward too.
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	Years later, my parents helped me move into my Cupertino apartment for my first job with this car. I'd drive to the Apple office and squeeze into those narrow parking slots. In my first week, I ran into a pole. And I'd pick up my then-girlfriend from the airport or from Berkeley on Fridays. She always had something to complain about the car, but I took the car's side every time. It was old by then, weathered, but it never complained.
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	I drove solo all over the Bay Area, from Santa Cruz to San Francisco to Pleasonton. Sometimes I'd park in shady areas, and sometimes shady people would follow me back to the car. In those moments, I'd really worry what would happen if the car didn't start. It always did though; I was immensely grateful for its unwavering loyalty. 
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	I brought this car to Seattle with me when I moved here two years ago. I brought home my little Pika in this car. He was crying so much for his mother that I thought hearts really do break, and his was breaking then. I always put him in the left backseat when it was just us two traveling together. He used to be so tiny that he couldn't even hop into the car when I opened the door; I had to pick him up and place him in his throne. As he got bigger, he'd sometimes crawl onto the trapdoor between the front two seats and watch me drive. I always wondered what he was thinking, and why he didn't just look out the window like other dogs. I thought maybe he could sense my dark thoughts still lingering on that left backseat window.
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	I took my then-girlfriend to Canada every other weekend in this car. I taught her to drive around her family's neighborhood and took her on her first freeway run in Surrey. We were once subject to random inspection at the Canadian border, but the officer let me go easy because he liked that I was a tech bro driving a modest car. We were in and out in 10 minutes. I really loved this car in that moment.
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	We decided to break up in this car during one of our drives home from Canada. It was a nice August day; peak Seattle weather, honestly. She wanted to move out, so I'd drive her to her apartment tours. While I waited for her to finish her tours, I'd sometimes sit in the left backseat and think about Pika, whether he'd miss me or remember me after we broke up. 
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	This car took me to the dealership in Auburn where I unceremoniously dumped it for $3600. $3600, can you believe it, Abdi? I pay a quarter of that in insurance each year. This car is surely crammed full of warm secrets, like family cutlery that's heard generations of teatime gossip. And I gave it up to a stranger for just $3600. I don't even need the money. A sad story, don't you think?"
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	Yes, that's it. That's what I should have said to him.
