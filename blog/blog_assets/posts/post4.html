										In most stories, the author nudges us to like certain characters more than others. This seems to work: I think most people share a deep appreciation for characters like Atticus Finch or Jean Valjean for example. In movies too, we generally sympathize with the characters the director wants us to. It's usually not even that subtle either, the way those biases manifest.
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	I wonder then. People have such rich variations in preferences, like what we find funny or whom we find attractive. We also have wildly polarizing political and religious views. How is it that millions of people with such different perspectives can read the same book or watch the same movie and naturally feel sympathetic toward the same characters? If there were a universal rubric by which we could inspire sympathy in others (and there does seem to be one), how is it that entire countries can go to war? I think of this line from <i>Speaker for the Dead</i>:
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	<i>No human being, when you understand his desires, is worthless. No one's life is nothing. Even the most evil of men and women, if you understand their hearts, had some generous act that redeems them, at least a little, from their sins... Once you understand what people really want, you can't hate them anymore. You can fear them, but you can't hate them, because you can always find the same desires in your own heart.</i>
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	I think if two soldiers met on the battlefield and exchanged the totality of their memories, they wouldn't be able to harm each other anymore because of these redeeming acts that make everyone lovable. That's not too surprising though: the tragedy of war falling to the hands of innocent people called to arms is well-studied, and there's no need to belabor the point. I think a more interesting thought experiment would be if we could bring together the heads of adversarial governments and have <i>them</i> exchange the totality of their memories. These are the big boys calling the shots. Shouldn't it be a prerequisite that they love each other?
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	I've often wondered if things might cool off between China and the U.S. if leaders of both governments got together once a year and taught each other how to bake brownies and egg tarts. Or if they traveled to Denmark together as private citizens and were forced to adapt to some culture neither is familiar with. The way I see it, opposing government officials are kind of like two strangers who have been abruptly forced to discuss how they want to raise their children when they haven't even gone through the courtship process yet. How are representatives of adversarial countries supposed to have productive conversations when they don't even understand each other half as well as we do our close friends and partners? If we can generally agree which characters deserve our admiration in literature, I feel like we should all share the same basic understanding of what makes a human worthy of respect and that we should be getting along a lot better than we currently do.
