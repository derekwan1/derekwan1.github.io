										<h1>Drowning</h1>
										<h2>August 24, 2025</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										For the first time in my life, I almost drowned.
									</p>
									<p>
										There's been a hurricane brewing on the east coast this week. It's hundreds of miles away to be sure, but what I didn't know is that even distant hurricanes can cause strong riptides. Another word I never even thought about before: "riptides." Strong currents that pull people hundreds of meters away from the shoreline. Normally, the lifeguards at the beach would shoo people away from the water in such conditions, but I make sure I'm done swimming before the first shift (I've always disdained lifeguards, even before I started open-water swimming). Unfortunately, yesterday was not a good day to adventure solo. 
									</p>
									<p>
										The funny thing is, when you're in the thick of things, the gravity of the situation doesn't really hit you. All I thought was, "Oh. I think I'm stuck." That, plus a vague sinking feeling that the shoreline was much farther away than it should've been given how much effort I was throwing at the water. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I remember choking on salt water, and feeling the membranes in my mouth swell. I remember my neck started to hurt, as my muscles started to compensate for my fatiguing lats. I remember the water getting colder and colder the farther I was swept away. Most of all, I remember tearing up. Not the desperate tearing up of someone clinging to survival as I would've expected. Instead, the tears leaked as I made a bleak, objective assessment of the situation and my life.
									</p>
									<p>
										1. I didn't know much about riptides before yesterday, but I knew that my determination was probably no match for a force of nature.
									</p>
									<p>
										2. I hadn't eaten that morning or slept much the previous night. In fact, I hadn't slept much for months. I was nowhere close to being in an optimal physical state to battle waves. 
									</p>
									<p>
										3. I have no family in New York. I go weeks without seeing friends. I live alone. The lifeguards wouldn't be there for another hour. My manager doesn't check in with me regularly. My coworkers often work from home. If I were to go missing, it would likely be my landlord because of a missed payment.
									</p>
									<p>
										These slow realizations were almost as crushing as the riptide itself. Did you know that rats will tread water twice the normal time if they think there's a reason to go on, that they'll be saved by their caretaker? Well, I'm a rat. I try when there's a reason to go on. And here, when things really, really mattered, I couldn't find a reason. I contemplated just letting go.
									</p>
									<p>
										I try, I really do, to connect with people, to make them feel seen and appreciated. But in doing so, I become invisible. Someone once told me, "I can't imagine you being anything other than happy." You have no idea.
									</p>
									<p>
										To you, the reader, those last few sentences unscroll in just a few lines until the last period, but to me, they turn like a wheel. They don't end. They catch me, smother me, and spin me back into darkness. You could say I've been eaten many times.
									</p>
									<p>
										When I reached the shore, everything and everyone carried on like normal. Absolutely nothing changed as a result of my ordeal. Whether I made it out or not would've made no difference. I even felt the faintest uprising of the thought, "How dare the world continue on like this as if nothing happened?" but I caught myself. Of course the world can carry on without me. How dare I think I have a solid claim to its love, or anyone's for that matter. 
									</p>
									<p>
										The tears didn't <i>really</i> start until I got home, exhausted and starving. I'd left the fridge door slightly ajar, and all the food had spoiled. It wasn't really the hunger that got to me. It's that I have this misguided idea that after a near-death experience, one comes home to a loving, warm environment, and the end credits roll. Instead, I still had to deal with stupid shit. Alone. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Sometimes I think I shouldn't have gotten out of that water. There's no space for me. I've been drowning for months.
