									<p>
										A few weeks ago, as I was puking on the beach after a particularly chilly open-water swim, I realized that swimming is more expressive and artistic to me than actual art.
									</p>
									<p>
										You can tell where someone's flexible or weak in their body by the way they push through the water. To me, the way people catch the water is their callsign. When I watch professional races, I can usually identify athletes by their stroke but not by their faces. And that's probably why I feel offended when I watch most people thrash around in a pool. It's like attending a ballet, but all the dancers on stage are crawling in circles instead of pirouetting. I feel deep disgust when I see uncontrolled, undisciplined, uncoordinated bodies floating back and forth in a pool.
									</p>
									<p>
										A pool is a careful environment, where people fret over the spacing of lane lines or the depth of the water or the salt-chlorine ratio. Everyday I drill myself, I keep thinking <i>control, control, control</i>: control the shoulder torque; watch the kicking cadence; head high; head down off the walls; adjust the elbow angle; watch the breathing; stay in the bow wave; stay tight going into the walls; press with the lats, not the shoulders. There are a million different ways to swim the same distance, and the way you tackle it says a lot about your body.
									</p>
									<p>
										But out in the ocean, it's like the water's taken its gloves off. The cold is unforgiving; my blood pressure spikes so high from the temperature it feels like I'm having a panic attack. It's complete darkness below the surface. The waves crush everyone in their path. None of the conventional techniques work to cut through the water faster. If a pool is a gallery, the ocean is billions of droplets at war with one another.
									</p>
									<p>
										I still feel elegance when I catch the water. The water's made of the same molecules. They're just charged with energy. There's no room or time to think of control, but I feel in control. Except in my head, I'm thinking <i>fight, fight, fight.</i> Fight the cold, the waves, the terror, the disorientation. It's weird feeling like a stranger in my own home. Blink, and you're lost to sea forever. But I like having to dig deep to survive. The way my body moves in response to nature's brutality is art to me. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I don't know what's gotten into me lately. Every day has to be laser-focused on <i>better, better, better.</i> <i>Better</i> is never satisfied being part of my life. It wants to be all of it. 
									</p>
									<p>
										My mind keeps drifting to this scene of Jinx boxing.
