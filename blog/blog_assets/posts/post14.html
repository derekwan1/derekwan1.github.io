										<h1>Drowning (Part 2)</h1>
										<h2>December 5, 2025</h2>
									</header>
									<p>
										Sometimes, without any particular reason, I hear a voice sounding off like a bell in my head.
									</p>
									<p>
										<i>This was never a place I was meant to be.</i>
									</p>
									<p>
										I've heard this bell go off everywhere I've been: LA, Taipei, Seattle, Vancouver, Portland, San Francisco, New York, and many more. It hits me out of the blue; a wave of sadness, and suddenly I'm floating. It feels like I'm not even here, like I'm a figment of my own imagination. I'm drifting on gossamer-thin threads. Something about the place and its people just doesn't fit. It seems there's no Derek-shaped hole for me to fill anywhere.
									</p>
									<p>
										The bell went off most recently when I was in one of Julliard's practice rooms late one night. For all the talk around Julliard's reputation by the way, the school is kind of a shit hole. It's old and musty. The elevators are slow. The air circulation in the practice rooms sucks. Many pianos have dead keys. The biggest library in the building doesn't even compare to Berkeley's shittiest, and Berkeley itself is a shit hole. And most of all, the lighting in the hallways is sickening, reminiscent of The Backrooms. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I left campus that night for the last time, feeling that I might collapse from loneliness. I physically ache for human contact, for someone to talk to who is neither being paid by me nor paying me. If people ask how you are on Monday, you are meant to say you're fine. You are not meant to say you stayed up all night long, thoughts richocheting in your head, because you had no one to talk to since signing off from work last Friday.
									</p>
									<p>
										Lately, I've been feeling like my senses have been dulled, like there's a muffler over all my sensory organs, or I'm underwater. It's hard to describe--I just don't <i>perceive</i> the world as much as I used to anymore. Everyday is like wading through a thick swamp. I remind myself to eat, to drink, to smile. And then I lie sleepless at night, reminding myself to breathe in and out until the next day. There's no sensory bandwidth for anything else.
									</p>
									<p> 
										I don't light up a room when I walk into it. No one longs to hear my voice. These are not statements of self pity. I'm stating the facts. Of course, I have plans. I have things I want to change about my life. But it's an eventual goal that remains on the horizon, which, like all horizons, recedes and cedes eternally. I squint at where I want to go, then slump off to the usual: beating my body, brain, and fingers to a pulp until there's no room for anything else.
									</p>
									<p>
										Part of the problem is I have no clue what to do with myself. I've never had time before--there was swimming, then college, then a relationship. I have more money and time than ever, but I never learned how to spend either. I even started looking to buy a 2B2B on the Upper West Side, not because I'm particularly investment savvy but because that just seems like what you're supposed to do when you're sitting on a fat pile of time and cash. Once that's out of the way, I'll really be lost. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I used to hate Conway, my deranged coach who ordered me around for half my adolescence and nearly broke me. Now, I wish he was here so he could tell me what to do. I'd rather be hurting from someone else than drifting aimlessly alone.
