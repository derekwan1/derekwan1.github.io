										<h1>Death Crawl</h1>
										<h2>June 12, 2025</h2>
									</header>

									<p>
										This city, these streets, I don't know why they make me so melancholic. I look closely at the nameless crowds, the hopes and resignation, the irritation and excitement. But everywhere, the same conversations and the same people. 
									</p>
									<p>
										<i>"I can't believe she invited Susan..."</i>
									</p>
									<p>
										<i>"My roommate gets so many matches that he's always sleeping at some new girl's place..."</i>
									</p>
									<p>
										<i>
											"You're so much better than that. You're going to come back..."
										</i>
									</p>
									<p>
										No surprises anywhere. In the most diverse city in the world, I just see the same person over and over again. Each person a copy-paste of the last. Except the copy-paste was done so poorly that the paste missed a few bits, and the paste took that error as a sign of singularity. 
									</p>
									<p>
										In these packed subway cars, these hordes of people on the sidewalks, these long lines in front of restaurants, I'm always searching for a spark. Anything to reignite my lust for life. Everywhere, infinite options, infinite possibilities. Infinity, and at the same time, zero. No matter how many faces pass me by, I don't remember any of them anymore.
									</p>
									<p>
										I've turned inward to cope. I practice so much piano that my wrists hurt when I type the next day. I work out like a maniac, sometimes 7 or even 8 times a week if I can't sleep. I started open-water swimming in the Atlantic. I commute an hour out of my way to be thrown around in freezing waves. Sometimes it even rains. The lifeguards hurl spittle in my face for swimming past the warning buoys. But I like that--the dark waters give me a kick I can't find anywhere else in this city. I think I even like the part where I'm yelled at too. It means someone cares enough to get angry.
									</p>
									<p>
										On this last point: one of the great mysteries of my life is that, despite being very in touch with my feelings, I don't cry when watching movies or reading books. All those critically acclaimed dog and love and family stories? They don't move me. That being said, the other day I actually watched one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and this death crawl clip from 3:15 to 3:46 made me bawl.

									</p>
									<p>
										I thought about that for a long time. Out of all the crazy things I've seen on TV or read in books--rape, incest, murder, death--this is what finally gets me to tear up?
									</p>
									<p>
										I realized it strikes a chord because it echoes my inner voice more closely than anything I've heard in a long time. When I hear someone else yell like that, I close my eyes and pretend I'm on the receiving end. It feels nice actually, like I'm finally getting what I deserve, only someone else is doing the flogging for me. It's comforting when someone else refuses to give me permission to quit when it hurts, like I don't have to carry this burden myself.
									</p>
									<p>
										On one of those days that I went open-water swimming, someone I met said that I'm incredibly bubbly. That saddened me a bit. Anyone can make grass look greener if they have enough manure. So if I look bubbly, it's probably because I'm full of shit. I wish I could find the words to say how I really feel, but they always catch in my throat. I turn to stone. I carry on. The same everyday, an endless death crawl. Tom Hanks in <i>Sleepless in Seattle</i> said it best: 
									</p>
									<p>
										<i>
											I'm going to get out of bed every morning, and breathe in and out all day long. And then, after a while I won't have to remind myself to get out of bed in the morning and breathe in and out. And then, after a while I won't have to think about how I had it great and perfect for a while.
