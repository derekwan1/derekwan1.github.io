										<h1>Pika</h1>
										<h2>June 23, 2025</h2>
									</header>

									<p>
										I found some of Pika's old toys while cleaning my apartment today. The movers must have grabbed them from my Seattle closet and dumped them here without me knowing. The toys still smell like him. I had to sit down.
									</p>
									<p>
										The first night I brought Pika home, I had to step out of the apartment for a few minutes. He was sleeping in his playpen when I left, and he was still there when I came back. I paid him no mind--I put away my shoes. And that's when I realized one of my slippers was missing.
									</p>
									<p>
										After searching for a bit, I realized what had happened. Pika had escaped from his playpen, grabbed my slipper, pushed the playpen back into place, and then returned to sleep on top of my slipper. He didn't even chew on it, as mouthy as he was as a puppy. I think the smell of my feet just made him feel safe. Back then he was so tiny that his entire body barely covered the length of the slipper. He could've slept on the blanket that still had his mother's scent. But no, he had chosen me. Me, who had been a complete stranger to him just 12 hours earlier. Seeing him curled up like that melted my heart. In those first few nights when it was just us two, I'd whisper into his ear as he fell asleep that I'd never leave him.
									</p>
									<p>
										I used to drive a white Lexus. My ex's grandma said that whenever Pika saw a white car drive by the house, he'd sit by the front door for 20 minutes, waiting to see when I'd get out and come to the door. And every time I left the house, he'd poke his little face through the blinds and watch me climb into the car and go. I could see his face from the street as I drove away. I never got used to that. It was devastating every time.
									</p>
									<p>
										When I left him for the last time, I planned to leave during his afternoon nap so I wouldn't have to see his face as I left. But as I was talking about dog logistics with my ex's dad, Pika woke up. He grabbed his favorite crocodile toy and started poking my leg with his nose, toy in mouth. His way of asking me to play tug-of-war. How I kept my composure, I don't know. I don't remember what I did after that. But I remember his tiny face watching me as I drove away for the final time, in a car that I don't even own anymore. And somehow, his crocodile toy is here with me in New York.
									</p>
									<p>
										My ex told me that Pika looks past her, looking for me, when she opens the door. I wonder in those moments if he thinks I abandoned him because I don't want him anymore. I wonder if he still waits for my white Lexus to show up. I wonder if he misses his crocodile toy. I wonder if he misses the smell of my feet. Mostly, I wonder if he's forgotten about me. It's for the best if he has. What I would give to be able to explain to him what happened...
									</p>
									<p>
										Sometimes I get hopeful, thinking that a person can't be judged solely on his past, that we're more than the mistakes and pain we caused yesterday, that we're all of our decisions, both past and future. But when I think about Pika, I don't think I can forgive myself. I'm sure I made the right decision in leaving him with my ex's family. But I should have never adopted him. After my first dog Maxie passed away, I promised myself I would never hold back love for the people I care about and that if I couldn't love fully, I wouldn't love at all. Then Pika happened. Those nights when I'd whisper in his ear meant nothing. Talk is cheap. It doesn't matter if the words are whispered to a dog or to another person; they stop meaning anything the moment they stop vibrating our eardrums. I remember so many conversations with people who are no longer a part of my life but at one point meant everything to me.
									</p>
									<p>
										Regret is never satisfied being a part of my life. It wants to be all of it.
