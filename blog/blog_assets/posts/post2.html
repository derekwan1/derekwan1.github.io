										<h1>Life That Breathes</h1>

									<p>Last week my life was headed in one direction. This week it’s headed in another.</p>
									<p>I feel like my life has been on pause, and I couldn’t quite figure out why for the longest time. But I can hazard a guess now. My world has been shrinking since I started working, and now it fits in my head. For the last few years, I could predict the shape of tomorrow with reasonable clarity. I think that’s what made me feel as though life had stopped moving forward. Nothing had gone astray: no setbacks from school or career, and I never really had much interpersonal trouble. Yet one day, I suddenly realized I was still stuck on Earth at a time when I thought I’d be at Saturn. I thought gravity would be displaced by wild ideas and energy, but I was very much still anchored—unhappily—to somewhere I hadn’t planned to be.</p>
									<p>I’m moving on from Seattle now, and the world has abruptly exploded from its tiny cradle in my head. All of a sudden, I’m no longer the big fish in my mental model of the world. I’m not even a scale on a fish. In fact, I’m not even a molecule on a scale of a fish. I’m an electron buzzing insignificantly around a molecule of a scale of a fish that’s swimming with countless other fish. </p>
									<p>I move in February, and I can’t predict what March will look like anymore. I don’t know whom I’ll talk to everyday or how they’ll react to what I say. Life isn’t theory anymore; it’s palpable and pulsating with uncertainty. I’m now a part of this world that I’ve heard so much about. I can’t sleep at night. And yet this is a welcome change. </p>
									<p>I don’t hate Seattle. It’s a part of myself; it’s my heart, and when I go, it’ll be a piece of my heart torn out and left behind. I love Seattle but not for its merits. I’ll always love this place because it’ll hold a snapshot of me. It’ll be a snapshot whose thoughts and decisions will inevitably seem alien as I grow older, but that’s what will make it so endearing. I’ll remember dancing in an empty living room during my first night alone here; the stand-up comedy I’d put on the TV while cooking; running shirtless in freezing wind and rain; singing lullabies to my little Pika before sunrise and hearing his doggy burps of happiness; swimming in lakes and for once feeling liberated by athleticism instead of trapped.</p>
									<p>I’m not so naïve to think that moving to NYC will solve all my problems, or that I'll "find myself" just because it's someplace else. I don’t remember if this is from a book or if I wrote this myself, but I found this interesting note on my phone from 8 years ago that's fitting for this moment:</p>
									<p><i>“One day you won't believe that you've done it but you will have done it. And then you'll think that the earth is beautiful and the air smells of spring and you love your fellow men because there is no evil in the world. And you'll set out from your house without a care in the world because you are so sure that the world will worship you for what you've done. But you won't travel far from your house because you'll be stopped at the door by the man who's come to turn off the gas. You hadn't had much food because you saved money to finish your work but still you had to cook something and you hadn't paid for it. That's when you remember your place. And then you know what? You'll go back inside and cry. You'll cry like an animal.”</i></p>
									<p>I know I’ll run into the gas man at some point, but I’ll enjoy this feeling for now. We don’t get too many opportunities like this, to revel in what seems like infinite possibility. In fact it's not infinite at all, but I'm going to savor every last second I can of this sweet anticipation before reality comes knocking.</p>
