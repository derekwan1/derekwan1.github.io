									<p>
										My light is gone.
									</p>
									<p>
										It would be erroneous to say that my light is "warm" or "dimly lit." A warm light is peace. A warm light is tranquility. A warm light is one emanated by someone who has found his place. A warm light is someone turning down the volume knob on life to relax. 
									</p>
									<p>
										No, my light is completely shut off. All of it.
									</p>
									<p>
										It's obvious from the moment I wake up. There's no more fire in my chest. Smiling feels like ripping my face in half. There's no color in my eyes when I look in the mirror. Everything is just dark. I don't feel like bouncing when I walk anymore. I'm a firefly that's outlived its shelf life. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I thought this kind of stuff didn't happen to me anymore. Turns out it doesn't matter if I'm 17 or 27. Heartbreak is still heartbreak. People still get to me. Time doesn't heal. That's just an optimistic framing of the fact that most people's memories are weak and fade quickly. But my memory is impeccable. I close my eyes when I pass through the 34th Street station. I walk on the west side of Central Park to avoid the Met. 
									</p>
									<p>
										This city is way too small.
