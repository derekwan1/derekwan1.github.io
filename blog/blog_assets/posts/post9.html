										<h1>David</h1>
										<h2>June 1, 2025</h2>
									</header>

									<p>
										From time to time I think about David, who used to sit next to me in French and beheaded himself our sophomore year.
									</p>
									<p>
										I'm just as surprised to read that sentence as you are, even now, almost 12 years after the beheading. To tell you the truth, he wasn't exactly a saint, but I won't speak ill of the dead. Succinctly, he wasn't a very popular kid for what I think were very valid reasons. 
									</p>
									<p>
										That being said, he didn't deserve the vitriol he attracted either. People would call fat people "David" and would openly ask to not be seated next to him. Teachers weren't very fond of him and turned the other way. I had PE with him once in middle school and remember a gang of kids prodding him around half naked in the locker room.
									</p>
									<p>
										What kills me is that I played a part in this too. While I didn't go out of my way to bully him, I laughed along when fat people were labeled "David." I didn't say anything when he was being poked in the locker room. I wasn't very warm to him when we did French exercises in pairs. I snarled at him for copying my homework. Once, in the 7th or 8th grade, I was racing a friend in PE and pushed David out of the way. I didn't apologize or help him get up--I just let those kids laugh at him. And for what? I can't even remember with whom I was racing. I don't remember the result or the time. 
									</p>
									<p>
										I don't know if David thought about that moment in his final days. But it must have pushed him an inch or two closer to suicide.
									</p>
									<p>
										The way he ended his life was so gruesome that I heard even the first responders needed PTSD therapy. There used to be a train that ran through town early each morning, and on one of those mornings, David laid his neck on the track and waited. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Self-harm I can understand. Suicide I can understand too, to some extent. Pulling a trigger is a split second of commitment. But lying in front of a train? You'd feel the terrifying mass reverberating in your bones before you saw it. You'd hear terrible screeching noises. You'd have ample time to get up and consider other options for ending your life. Yet he lay there until the very end. How much does one have to hate himself to commit to that kind of death? He was a <i>kid</i>, with two normal parents and a normal brother. He wasn't a great student, but he wasn't stupid. He could have slacked his way through school and done decently well for himself. He had a future, even if his talents weren't obvious.
									</p>
									<p>
										Sometimes when I hear a clock ticking, I think of how many ticks, how many minutes, how many hours and days and weeks and months and years I'll have to carry this guilt. Let hardship and heartbreak come my way. I deserve it all. I'm a pallid beach where the footprints of people who have touched my life wash away beneath endless, crashing waves of sorrow. Most people never become individuals to me. Theyâ€™re just afterimages.
									</p>
									<p>
										There is no atonement, no beautiful redeeming lesson to be learned. No, my penance is to yearn to do something only when nothing more can be done. That, and a conscious decision to not look away when David pops into my head.
									</p>
									<p>
										I try my hardest to remember everything I can about David. I knew him well and not at all. His face is burned onto the back of my eyelids. I know the way he dressed; I know the way he ran; I know the way he spoke, like he was always being squeezed. From one of our French conversations, I know that his life goal was to own a small apartment with a large TV where no one could bother him. He wanted to order endless pizza every day.
									</p>
									<p>
										But I don't know how he felt when he ate lunch alone. I don't know if he ever tried talking to his family about what was going on at school. I don't know what he would have wanted for his birthday or Christmas.
									</p>
									<p>
										I don't even know his last name.
