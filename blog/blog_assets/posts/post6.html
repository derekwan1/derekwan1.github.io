									<p>
										I think most religions have some notion of the afterlife, where you'll reunite with the souls of all your loved ones. Yet this promise is also one of the biggest plot holes in religion. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Say you're wedded to a loving partner for 50 years, but then Alzheimer's or brain cancer alters his or personality beyond recognition. If you were to meet your partner again in heaven, which version would you see? The most recent version? The most loving version? The version right before the onset of disease? I think most Christians wouldn't hesitate to say something hopeful, like "the essence of your partner's soul will be distilled in God's presence." But I feel like this is just wishful thinking. For one, even without brain diseases, we change a lot. How can you distill a soul that is constantly changing?
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	Adding to the twist: I think I read somewhere that every cell in your body is recycled / retired every seven years, so not even your physical being persists for very long. DNA sticks around, but even that picks up mutations. Memories are persisted, but I'm pretty sure there are studies in criminology showing that memories are unreliable and malleable. So really, none of us are the same person for very long, physically or emotionally. When God said "you" get to go to heaven, who would have thought he'd need to be more specific?
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	There are some other technicalities that I think are a bit absurd. If I understand correctly, each person has a soul, and that soul persists from conception until the afterlife. Conception is a sperm fusing with an egg. So in the exact moment that two haploid genomes fuse, that cell is suddenly imbued with a soul? And in the millisecond preceding this fusion, these cells had no soul? So a soul is created from the combination of two soulless entities? What on Earth? 
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	The other concern I have is that of God's omnipotence. If God is omnipotent, then it must be true that He can create a rock that is so heavy He cannot lift it. This is a contradiction. If we wrote a proof that went like "If A is true, then 1=0" we'd say that the original assumption A must be false because 1 cannot be equal to 0: if we conclude a contradiction from A, then A must not be true. So naturally it follows that God (or anyone else) <i>cannot</i> be omnipotent. And well, most of the Bible is predicated on God being omnipotent, so it also follows that the Bible can't be that reliable. 
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	There's also the matter of salvation. When something tragic happens like a baby dying from cancer, the devout whisper that it's all right because God has a plan and that God works in myserious ways. Mysterious indeed. God imbued a newly fertilized egg with a soul and then immediately dismantled its body as soon as it birthed, reclaiming the soul that was just created and traumatizing an entire family. Well, maybe the family will go on to channel their grief into some productive proselytizing efforts, but what about the baby? Christians are told they are here in the present life to glorify God (i.e., live according to ways that please Him and prepare to spend eternity with God). The baby never had that chance. What I have heard from Christians is that this baby would still go to heaven because... it's fair? The baby never had the chance to hear the word of Jesus, so he gets a free pass. So what about the millions of adult Muslims who probably never were even given the chance to hear about Christianity? Do they go to heaven too? What about the millions of people living in poverty and don't have any religion at all because they've never heard of one?
								    </p>
								    <p> 
								    	IIRC I asked a pastor this, and he said all these groups would go to heaven because God is just and they weren't given enough resources / exposure to God to make a decision. Ah, how convenient that God carves out so many exceptions. Do I get to go to heaven too because I didn't have the chance to meet a pastor who was convincing enough for me to make a decision?
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	Finally, there's the more simple matter of feeling God's presence. I once went to a volunteering event where we handed out food to the homeless. Before we began, the church leader read some verses to us (we were holding hands in a circle), and by the end of it she was weeping passionately, saying "I just know that Jesus is here. He's right here with us. I can feel Him so strongly." Some of the other Christians in our circle were nodding along, also crying. Here's what I don't understand: God is open to all, and there are no preconditions to the religion. I'm an open person, and I was open then. Why is it that God's presence is so real to some people that they can't help crying, yet people like me feel nothing? Shouldn't God's presence feel as unequivocal as heat or cold? It shouldn't just be obvious to those with confirmation bias. 
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	I used to look down on Christians because I felt that they were using religion as an emotional crutch. But now, I think that almost everyone has some sort of emotional crutch, and for Christians that just happens to be the Bible. If I were to look down on Christians, I'd have to laugh at myself too. My emotional crutches are no more rational. Oddly enough, the only way for me to feel better about myself is to hurl vicious invective at myself while I exercise to exhaustion; the exercise alone does nothing to dispel the darkness. Somewhat loosely, I thought of this line from <i>Life of Pi</i>.
								    </p>
								    <p>
								    	<i>"The reason darkness sticks so closely to life isn't biological necessity. It's envy. Life is so beautiful that darkness has fallen in love with it, a jealous possessive love that grabs at what it can."</i>
